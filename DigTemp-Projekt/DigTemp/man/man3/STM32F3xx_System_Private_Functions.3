.PP
Update SystemCoreClock variable according to Clock Register Values\&. The SystemCoreClock variable contains the core clock (HCLK), it can be used by the user application to setup the SysTick timer or configure other parameters\&. 
.PP
\fBNote:\fP
.RS 4
Each time the core clock (HCLK) changes, this function must be called to update SystemCoreClock variable value\&. Otherwise, any configuration based on this variable will be incorrect\&.
.PP
- The system frequency computed by this function is not the real frequency in the chip\&. It is calculated based on the predefined constant and the selected clock source:
.RE
.PP
.IP "\(bu" 2
If SYSCLK source is HSI, SystemCoreClock will contain the \fBHSI_VALUE(*)\fP
.IP "\(bu" 2
If SYSCLK source is HSE, SystemCoreClock will contain the \fBHSE_VALUE(**)\fP
.IP "\(bu" 2
If SYSCLK source is PLL, SystemCoreClock will contain the \fBHSE_VALUE(**)\fP or \fBHSI_VALUE(*)\fP multiplied/divided by the PLL factors\&.
.PP
.PP
(*) HSI_VALUE is a constant defined in stm32f3xx_hal\&.h file (default value 8 MHz) but the real value may vary depending on the variations in voltage and temperature\&.
.PP
(**) HSE_VALUE is a constant defined in stm32f3xx_hal\&.h file (default value 8 MHz), user has to ensure that HSE_VALUE is same as the real frequency of the crystal used\&. Otherwise, this function may have wrong result\&.
.PP
.IP "\(bu" 2
The result of this function could be not correct when using fractional value for HSE crystal\&. 
.PP

.SS "void SystemInit (void)"
